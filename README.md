# 🎨 jsdemo

**jsdemo** is not just a repository.  
It’s a vibe. A little experiment in *live coding*, *generative visuals*, and the magic of automation.  

Every day, a fresh **demo** is born here — with code, with cover art, with a GitHub Release, and with a post to [Telegram @jsdemo](https://t.me/jsdemo).  
Think of it as a diary of creative coding, but written in pixels and scripts instead of words.

## ✨ What happens here
- **Auto-generated demos**: HTML/JS snippets exploring visual patterns, motion, and randomness.  
- **Covers**: Each release has a generated cover image — part art, part timestamp.  
- **Publishing ritual**: At 06:00 UTC the scripts spin, and a new artifact lands on GitHub Pages + Telegram.  
- **Archive**: All past demos stay available for browsing, remixing, and inspiration.

## 🛠 For contributors
This is an open-ended playground.  
Got an idea for a demo? A script? A visual hack? Open an [Issue](https://github.com/digitalartware/jsdemo/issues) or a Pull Request.  

- Minimal rules.  
- Code should stay self-contained (no heavy deps).  
- Aesthetic is secondary to experimentation.

## 📜 Credits
- Generated by automation, curated by accidents.  
- Inspired by the spirit of **creative coding** and **daily sketching**.  

---

## 🌀 Why?
Because art and code deserve to collide every day.
